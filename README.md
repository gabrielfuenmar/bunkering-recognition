# Bunkering Recognition Algorithm
Generates bunkering information from raw AIS data at the Mediterranean Sea from January, 2013 to June, 2019.
[Pseudocode](https://github.com/gabrielfuenmar/bunkering-recognition/blob/master/pseudo.pdf) available at the repository.

Distributed computing setting under Sun Grid manager deployed in a Round Robin configuration see bunker_mpi.sh.

MPI setting recognizes any distributed environment.

AIS information used as input and Vessel Specifications are not displayed here as restrictred by the suppliers.

[Results](https://github.com/gabrielfuenmar/bunkering-recognition/blob/master/bunkering_ops_mediterranean.csv) from the Mediterranean Operations does not shows the statistic population as the algorithm is dependent in the quality of AIS sequence. However, validation of the results can be observed at ##PAPER WHEN PUBLISHED###.

Dependencies:

    pandas 0.25.1
    geopandas 0.6.1
    shapely 1.6.4
    numpy 1.17.2
    mpi4py  3.0.2

Parameters:
        
    alongside_poly: geopandas dataframe with manually constructed polygons off shore.
    port_barge: pandas dataframe with match of ports and servicing barges.
    bunker_poly: geopandas dataframe of ports polygons.
    done: pandas dataframe from reaaded list at done.txt file. Initially empty.
    vessels_all: pandas dataframe with vessels specs. Not uploaded as restricted by the supplier.
    positions: pandas dataframe of vessels positions. Not uploaded as restricted by the supplier.

Returns:
    
    CSV file with bunkering statistics.

The information is build per vessel based on the correct sequence of three operations (Bunker barges recognition [Results as port_barge dataframe], Stopped Vessel and Vessel-Barge rendezvous).

A rough visual description of the algorithm looks as follows:
1. Port filter

2. Stopped vessel at anchor

3. Vessel-barge rendezvous
